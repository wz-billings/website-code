* Project One: {{% staticref "files/project1.pdf" %}} Integrated pest management {{% /staticref %}}.
* Project Two: {{% staticref "files/project2.pdf" %}} Three-population Lotka-Volterra {{% /staticref %}}.
* Project Three: {{% staticref "files/modeling_paper.pdf" %}} Linear cancer models (paper) {{% /staticref %}}; {{% staticref "files/modeling_presentation.pdf" %}} final presentation {{% /staticref %}}.
* All work was done in Mathematica, and all files can be found in my [Github repo](https://github.com/wz-billings/Math_430).
* (Header image is the phase space, showing flow magnitudes, of a problem with a Hamiltonian quantity; the system had to be modified to obtain the Hamiltonian for the original system, and I wanted to graphically show that the two systems were not the same despite having the same Hamiltonian.)
